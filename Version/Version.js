
/* There is one version number that is used for all the tax tools. This is useful because
 * there is a lot of shared code between the tools. The shared code is in the Library
 * folders.
 *
 * This file defines the version mnumber of the tax tools in the variable below. The variable
 * can be displayed in HTML code using a section of code similar to this:
 *
 *		<p class="version-number">Version: <a href="../Version/Version.html">
 *			<span id="TaxToolsVersion"></span></a></p>
 *
 * In addition to inserting the version number in the paragraph, this code makes the version
 * number a clickable link so that when it is clicked, the version log is displayed.
