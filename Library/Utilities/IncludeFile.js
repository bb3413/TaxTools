// This function allows an HTML file to include another file using a statement
// like this:
//
//		<div include-file="filename"> Missing IncludeFile.js </div>
//
// The way this works is the function scans the document for HTML elements with
// the attribute "include-file". Any element that is found is replaced with the
// file named as the value of the attribute.
//
// Problems:
//		- Do not use document.write() in an included file; it will wipe out the
//			entire page.
//		- If the HTML file is opened by double clicking on it, the fetch command
//			will fail for security reasons. The file needs to be loaded from a
//			server.
